                    					PaintPad -Presentation
 
I wanted to combine a simple NotePad I made as part of a User Interfaces course with some Paint-like features. So here's PaintPad. 

PaintPad Features:
	- Ability to Open and Edit text files and .png files. If a .png file is opened only the paint features are available. 
	- Ability to save your text files and an option to save text + paint as a .png file. Ctrl + S shortcut works. 
	- Text editor features:
		- Very minimal notepad like features. Ability to change Font Size from Format. 
		- Copy & Paste work as well as Undo. Ctrl + shortcuts are also available. 
	- Paint canvas features:
		- Ability to enable/disable painting by selecting the pen icon. This also disables/enables text editing. 
		
		
		- You can choose between 3 brush sizes by pressing the dot icon. 

		
		- You can choose between 6 colors. White works as an eraser. 
	
	
		- You can select the circle to enable/disable Ellipse drawing tool. You can draw ellipses with it.


In addition to PaintPad you can change the language from the Help -menu. This takes advantage of Resources. 
Has English (default), Finnish & Swedish. 
There is also a calculator which you can access from the Help menu. This was an assignment done during my course.
